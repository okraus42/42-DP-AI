# 42-DP-AI
42 AI Discovery Piscine

Feedback:
Good:
- Option to register future modules
- eval sheet seems to be actually tailored to specific exercises
- system/AI agnostic
- can be done on personal laptop using AI person is familiar with

Not great:
- Only 4 evals (two evals per module would be possible)
- no coding
- sometimes it is needed to submit prompt, sometimes result, sometimes both, very inconsistent and confusing for no reason.
- only one bonus exercise, would be nice to have some optional bonus in every exercise
- the image generating module seemed much more stricter and rigorous than the rest

Bad:
- sometimes mismatch between subject and evaluation
