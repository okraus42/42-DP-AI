Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in recruitment, particularly for pre-selecting CVs. However, despite their appearance of neutrality, these technologies can reproduce and even reinforce human biases. One of the main concerns about the use of AI in CV sorting is the way it can perpetuate discrimination based on characteristics such as age, gender, or ethnic origin.

For example, an AI trained on historical data could learn to favor white candidates over 50 years old if, in the past, this group was overrepresented in the positions to be filled. The algorithm, based on this data, could conclude that this profile is the most likely to succeed, even if this simply reflects prejudices and discriminatory practices in the recruitment process. This bias can manifest subtly, for example, by giving exaggerated importance to certain experiences or training that are statistically more common among people in this group.

Similarly, for positions perceived as traditionally female, such as nursing jobs, an AI could favor women’s CVs. If historical data shows that the majority of people in these positions were women, the algorithm could develop an association between the female gender and success in this type of role, potentially excluding qualified men.

These biases are not intentional, but they are inherent in the operation of AIs that rely on past data. If the training data reflects inequalities or stereotypes, the algorithm’s decisions will be biased. It is therefore crucial to use diversified data and to set up bias correction mechanisms to prevent the AI from reproducing discriminatory patterns. Companies must also be vigilant in regularly evaluating the algorithms used in their recruitment processes to ensure that these tools contribute to greater fairness, rather than perpetuating existing inequalities.
In short, the use of AIs in CV selection carries risks of bias related to age, gender, and ethnic origin. It is essential to take measures to ensure that these tools do not become amplifiers of injustices, but rather levers to promote inclusion and diversity.

Here is the French translation of the text, rendered as accurately and professionally as possible:

Les systèmes d’intelligence artificielle (IA) sont de plus en plus utilisés dans le recrutement, notamment pour la présélection des CV. Cependant, malgré leur apparente neutralité, ces technologies peuvent reproduire, voire renforcer, les biais humains. L’un des principaux sujets de préoccupation concernant l’utilisation de l’IA dans le tri des CV réside dans sa capacité à perpétuer des discriminations fondées sur des caractéristiques telles que l’âge, le genre ou l’origine ethnique.

Par exemple, une IA entraînée à partir de données historiques pourrait apprendre à favoriser des candidats blancs de plus de 50 ans si, par le passé, ce groupe était surreprésenté dans les postes à pourvoir. L’algorithme, basé sur ces données, pourrait en conclure que ce profil est le plus susceptible de réussir, alors qu’il ne fait que refléter des préjugés et des pratiques discriminatoires présents dans le processus de recrutement. Ce biais peut se manifester de manière subtile, par exemple en accordant une importance excessive à certaines expériences ou formations statistiquement plus fréquentes chez les personnes appartenant à ce groupe.

De la même manière, pour des postes traditionnellement perçus comme féminins, tels que les emplois dans le domaine infirmier, une IA pourrait favoriser les CV de femmes. Si les données historiques montrent que la majorité des personnes occupant ces postes étaient des femmes, l’algorithme pourrait développer une association entre le genre féminin et la réussite dans ce type de rôle, excluant ainsi potentiellement des hommes qualifiés.

Ces biais ne sont pas intentionnels, mais ils sont inhérents au fonctionnement des IA qui s’appuient sur des données du passé. Si les données d’apprentissage reflètent des inégalités ou des stéréotypes, les décisions de l’algorithme seront biaisées. Il est donc crucial d’utiliser des données diversifiées et de mettre en place des mécanismes de correction des biais afin d’éviter que l’IA ne reproduise des schémas discriminatoires. Les entreprises doivent également faire preuve de vigilance en évaluant régulièrement les algorithmes utilisés dans leurs processus de recrutement, afin de s’assurer que ces outils contribuent à plus d’équité, et non à la perpétuation des inégalités existantes.

En somme, l’usage des IA dans la sélection de CV comporte des risques de biais liés à l’âge, au genre et à l’origine ethnique. Il est essentiel de prendre des mesures pour que ces outils ne deviennent pas des amplificateurs d’injustices, mais plutôt des leviers au service de l’inclusion et de la diversité.

Title: Earth 2100 – A Converging Future
1. The Climate-Adapted Planet
Summary:
By 2100, average global temperatures have risen by 2.5–3°C. Coastal cities have implemented massive flood defenses or relocated inland. Agriculture has shifted geographically due to changes in rainfall and heat, with vertical farms and desalination-powered irrigation becoming critical. Carbon capture and solar geoengineering are deployed cautiously to stabilize the climate.

2. Post-Scarcity Energy
Summary:
Solar, wind, nuclear fusion, and advanced battery technologies have replaced fossil fuels almost entirely. Power is cheap, abundant, and decentralized. Smart grids balance global energy demands, and hydrogen is widely used for transport and industrial applications.

3. The AI-Guided Economy
Summary:
Artificial intelligence has transformed the global economy. Routine jobs are almost fully automated. AI advisors manage personal finance, career development, logistics, and governance. Universal Basic Income (UBI) or similar support systems are common, enabling people to pursue creative, caregiving, or scientific endeavors.

4. The Rise of Mega-Cities and Climate Retreat Zones
Summary:
Urban populations dominate, with mega-cities housing 50+ million people each. Some low-lying nations have fully relocated. In contrast, “climate retreat zones” in the Arctic, Scandinavia, and parts of Canada and Russia become new economic hubs, attracting climate migrants and development.

5. Health, Longevity, and Bioenhancement
Summary:
Thanks to gene editing (like CRISPR), AI diagnostics, and nanomedicine, average life expectancy now exceeds 100 years in many countries. Aging is treated more like a manageable condition than an inevitability. Some opt for cognitive and physical enhancements, raising ethical and social questions.

6. The Learning Ecosystem
Summary:
Education is lifelong, AI-personalized, and immersive. Virtual and augmented reality classrooms allow global collaboration. Traditional degrees are replaced by skill-based certifications updated in real time. Curiosity-driven learning is prioritized over rigid curricula.

7. Society and Identity in Flux
Summary:
Cultural identities have become more fluid in a globally connected world. With virtual communities outweighing geographic ones, people often belong to multiple digital "nations." Gender, ethnicity, and nationality are more self-defined. Mental health is a core public health focus, supported by AI therapists and community hubs.

8. Governance in a Networked World
Summary:
Governance has moved toward transparency and decentralization. Blockchain-based systems ensure secure voting and real-time citizen feedback. AI helps policymakers simulate the outcomes of decisions before they are implemented. Supranational bodies have more authority in managing climate, migration, and digital rights.

9. The Earth and Beyond
Summary:
Space colonization has begun with permanent settlements on the Moon and Mars, primarily for scientific and commercial purposes. Asteroid mining is a reality. Space travel is not yet mainstream but is expanding rapidly. Earth remains humanity’s home, but the species is now multi-planetary.

10. Ethics, Risk, and Human Purpose
Summary:
Humanity faces philosophical questions: What is meaningful work in a post-labor society? Should there be limits to human enhancement? Can AI truly understand human values? Amid progress, the 22nd century begins with an awareness of risks—technological, ecological, and existential—balanced by cautious optimism and a drive for shared purpose.
